    <h1>Exploring the Gender Wage Gap</h1>
    <h2>By Cresonia Hsieh</h2>
<p>The data tables below explore the concept of the gender wage gap. The first table shows that women earn more than men up until 39 hours of work per week after adjusting by median weekly earnings per hours worked. After 40 hours of work per week, men earn more than women. The second chart is a supplement to the first chart by attempting to explore a reason why women may earn less than men on average. By looking at high-paying fields of study, the charts show that men typically dominate high-paying fields. This may be a reason why women earn less than men on average.</p>
